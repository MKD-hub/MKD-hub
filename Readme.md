Hi, I'm Mohammed 👋

🔭 Current focus

This year, I'm deliberately investing most of my time into:

Strengthening core backend foundations (data structures, algorithms, networking)

Building low-level tools in Zig

Exploring WebAssembly constraints, memory models, and error propagation

Treating graphics as a systems problem, not just rendering

Trying to learn as much as I can!

🛠️ Selected projects

**Coming soon!**This section will be expanded once I publish one of my first few tools.

For now, my work is centered around tooling and primitives that can later support more complex systems.

📐 Backend foundations

I actively work on backend fundamentals with an emphasis on:

Clear mental models over rote solutions

Understanding tradeoffs between approaches

Writing code that is easy to reason about and evolve

This includes ongoing practice with data structures, algorithms, and system design concepts, often informed by constraints I encounter in lower-level work.

🧠 Topics I care about

Memory models & allocators

Error handling and failure modes

Determinism in real-time systems

WASM sandbox constraints

Data-oriented design

Tooling that compounds over time

✍️ Learning in public

I occasionally write about what I'm building and learning:

Short-form discussions with local developers:

My goal is clarity and reflection.

I care more about understanding systems deeply than moving fast — and I’m comfortable taking the long route to get there

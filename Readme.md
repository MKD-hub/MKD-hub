# Hi, I'm Mohammed 👋

## 🔭 Current focus

This year, I'm deliberately investing most of my time into:

- Strengthening core backend foundations (data structures, algorithms, networking)

- Building low-level tools in Zig

- Exploring WebAssembly constraints, memory models, and error propagation

- Treating graphics as a systems problem, not just rendering

Trying to learn as much as I can!

## 🛠️ Selected projects

**Coming soon!**This section will be expanded once I publish one of my first few tools.

For now, my work is centered around tooling and primitives that can later support more complex systems.

## 📐 Backend foundations

I actively work on backend fundamentals with an emphasis on:

- Clear mental models over rote solutions

- Understanding tradeoffs between approaches

- Writing code that is easy to reason about and evolve

This includes ongoing practice with data structures, algorithms, and system design concepts, often informed by constraints I encounter in lower-level work.

## 🧠 Topics I care about

- Memory models & allocators

- Error handling and failure modes

- Determinism in real-time systems

- WASM sandbox constraints

- Data-oriented design

- Tooling that compounds over time

## ✍️ Learning in public

I occasionally write about what I'm building and learning:

- Long-form notes: Substack[https://substack.com/@moccamo]

- Short-form discussions with local developers:

My goal is clarity and reflection.

## 📫 Get in touch

If you're interested in backend or systems-oriented engineering, or in using tools and games as a medium for learning, feel free to reach out to me on my Telegram Channel.

I care more about understanding systems deeply than moving fast — and I’m comfortable taking the long route to get there
